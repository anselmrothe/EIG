* Support for precomputing of complicated priors.

* Consider interfaces with LOT library: https://github.com/piantado/LOTlib/blob/master/Documentation/Tutorial.md

* Can code for parser can be automatically generated from grammar rules?

* Detailed computation for non-deterministic questions.

* Refactor code to support tasks other than Battleship.

* Consider re-implement more parts in c++ for efficiency.
